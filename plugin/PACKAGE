  <p>
  This plugin allows the user to find metadata in a JPEG image and copy it to the clipboard.
  It was made to pick up information injected into the JPEG metadata where "MAKE" has a list with
  the coordinates of the images in the contact sheet and "ARTIST" has a list of locations on disk
  for each.
